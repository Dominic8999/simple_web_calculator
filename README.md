# Simple Calculator

Here's my very own simple calculator available via web browser. This simple little project was built in:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Boostrap

This simple calculator is able to:
- add two numbers
- substract two numbers
- divide two numbers
- multiply two numbers
  (Also, the negative numbers are allowed as well)

# Here's a preview how this looks on a desktop:
